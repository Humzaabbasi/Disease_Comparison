# Year-Wise Disease Comparison

## Introduction
This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of disease trends across different years, allowing healthcare professionals and policymakers to make data-driven decisions. It features three slicers - "Select Year," "Select Hospital," and "Search Diagnose" - to enable dynamic data filtering and exploration. The primary visualization consists of line charts that compare disease occurrences over the selected years, with each year represented in the legends. Additionally, the dashboard presents a count of diagnoses by month and displays the top 20 diagnoses for further insights.

## Key Features
### Slicer Selection:
- **Select Year:** Users can filter data by selecting specific years to focus on for disease comparison.
- **Select Hospital:** Enables users to view disease statistics for a particular hospital, allowing for hospital-specific analysis.
- **Search Diagnose:** Users can search for specific diagnoses, making it easier to explore diseases of interest.

### Year-Wise Disease Comparison (Line Charts):
- Line charts visualize disease trends over the selected years, with each year represented as a separate line. This aids in identifying patterns and changes over time.

### Diagnoses by Month:
- A monthly breakdown of diagnoses is provided to highlight seasonal trends and variations in disease occurrences.

### Top 20 Diagnoses (Slicer):
- Users can select and explore the top 20 most common diagnoses, allowing for a detailed analysis of prevalent diseases.

## Benefits
- **Temporal Analysis:** The dashboard enables users to track disease trends across different years, helping healthcare professionals identify emerging health issues.
- **Hospital-Specific Insights:** The "Select Hospital" slicer allows for the evaluation of hospital-specific disease patterns, aiding in resource allocation and healthcare planning.
- **Diagnose Search:** Researchers and clinicians can easily find and analyze specific diagnoses of interest.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** The monthly diagnoses breakdown helps in identifying seasonal variations in diseases.

## Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for healthcare professionals, researchers, and policymakers. It empowers users to perform in-depth year-wise disease comparisons, explore hospital-specific data, and investigate specific diagnoses. By leveraging the provided slicers and visualizations, stakeholders can make informed decisions, allocate resources effectively, and gain insights into disease trends for improved healthcare planning.
